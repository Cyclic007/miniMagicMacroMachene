# miniMagicMacroMachene

#### May 16 (part 1) (1.5hr)

##### the start

The idea for this project is a small macro pad that can be used with a laptop effectively

Today I am making a BOM and finding the things that are needed for the PCB design and starting on the 3d Model



#### May 16(part 2) (4 hr)

created the PCB and finished PCB and found

- https://cherry.saas.contentserv.com/admin/rest/document/30?ContextIDs=15343&Language=1

these are the parts I will be using and hopefully 3d print the rest.

#### May 17 (3.5hr)

Found venders for PCB parts and found what key switches I am going to use

- https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/products/cherry-mx2a-black-60g-linear?variant=48014721286444

also found pricing for the parts 

also got a quote for the PCB of 20.06 from PCBway (including shipping)

Found a plugin that will make creating the case infinitely easier allowing communication between freecad and Kicad 

tryed useing FreeCad to make case and am not doing very well at it 

Found a tool called turbocase that generates a scad file for a case for a pcb and I used it to generate the bottom case

also made the BOM
